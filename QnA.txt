1. How data packets or chunks work in http requests?

    Suppose you're downloading this JSON:

    {"name": "Jawad", "role": "Engineer"}

    This might be split into:

    Step     contents           size 
    ----------------------------------
    1        {"name": "Jaw      13            
    2        ad", "role": "     14            
    3        Engineer"}         10            



2. Difference between c type strings and std::string?

    C type strings are just character arrays terminated by a '\0'

    Std:: strings are part of the C++ standard library using complex logic to handle strings with classes

    Feature              C-style                   C++ 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type                 Array of chars            Class              
    Resizable?           No                        Yes                
    Used in libcurl?     since it's a C lib        not directly     



3. Why to parse the response to JSON? what format is the response berfore the parse and after the parse?

    Before parsing the result is a string that contains raw text that looks like a structure or a json object:
    
    `{
        "name": "Jawad",
        "role": "Engineer",
        "skills": ["React", "Node.js", "C++"]
    }`

    After parsing raw JSON string turns into a json object where now you can access data by key just like structures.

    string name = data["name"];         // "Jawad"
    string role = data["role"];         // "Engineer"
    string skill0 = data["skills"][0];  // "React"
